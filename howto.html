    	<h1>Entrance to Bath</h1>
    	<p> First, put your shoes in the locker located at the entrance. Lock your locker by pulling the wooden card key out of the locker door and keep your key with you as you enter.</p>

    	<p>Pay a fee at the Bandai or the front desk (about 460 yen depending on the area) In traditional Sento, baths for men and women are separated at the entrance and the Bandai faces the bath areas, not the entrance, for security purposes. These days, the front-desk style is mainly used, and the bath areas are separated after you pay the admission fee.</p>

		<p>Once you pay the fee, take off your clothes and put them into a locker. Lock the locker, put the key around your wrist, and enter the bath area.</p>
